## Main Screen

In the Main Screen of Small Buds you can learn about the three kinds of plants divided into the categories:

```
Succulents | Herbs | Flowers
```

To learn more about a specific plant such as:
```
SunLIGHT a plant needs to be exposed to.
The amount WATERING to be used on a plant.
The TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE for the plant to survive in.
The HOUSE KEEPING or the location the plant can settle at.
Finally, any USEFUL INFORMATION about the plant.
```

An image will appear showing what the plant would look like along with its potential DIFFICULTY to manage.

Please exit out of the window in order to look at more plants OR check our quiz to see what plant would suit you.

Based on a point system, you can determine what plants are suitable for you!

You can exit out of the application at any time. You can also click on ABOUT THE APP to view more information that could be helpful towards your knowledge in plants as well as the goal of the "Small Buds" application.

## The Quiz

The quiz will take in your specific input using the instructions in the "Instructions" tab. From these pieces of information, your score will be totalled up into the best fitting plant type for you. You may then take your information and check out potential starting plants in that category on the main page. Remember, this is only a suggestion! Don't feel limited by the results in any way - they are merely a recommendation based on the information provided in the quiz for the easiest fit into your life.
